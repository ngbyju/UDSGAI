    "NumPy broadcasting is a powerful and flexible mechanism for working with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations. It allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays that would normally require them to have the exact same shape, often without actually making copies of the data, which makes it very efficient.\n",

    "The Broadcasting Rules\n",
    "NumPy's broadcasting rules are applied dimension by dimension, starting from the trailing dimension (the rightmost one). Two dimensions are compatible when:\n",
    "\n",
    "They are equal.\n",
    "One of them is 1.\n",
    "If neither of these conditions is met, a ValueError is raised (e.g., \"operands could not be broadcast together with shapes...\").\n",

    "A task is a unit of work â€” something your program needs to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be anything: downloading a file, handling a user request, or performing a calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In multithreading, each task is often assigned to a separate thread for concurrent execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Example:\n",
    "def task1():\n",
    "    print(\"Task 1 is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def task2():\n",
    "    print(\"Task 2 is running\")\n",

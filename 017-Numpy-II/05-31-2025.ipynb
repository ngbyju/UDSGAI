    "# Boolean Indexing\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean indexing (also known as boolean masking) is a powerful and very common way to select elements from a NumPy array based on a condition. Instead of using integer indices, you use a boolean array of the same shape as your original array. Where the boolean array is True, the corresponding element from the original array is selected; where it's False, it's not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation effectively \"masks\" the array, showing only the elements that meet your criteria. The result of boolean indexing is always a 1-dimensional array containing the selected elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "Create a boolean mask: You typically get a boolean mask by performing a comparison operation on your NumPy array (e.g., arr > 5, arr % 2 == 0). This operation will return a new boolean array of the same shape as arr.\n",
    "Apply the mask: You then use this boolean mask inside the square brackets [] to index your original array.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "1. Basic Boolean Indexing (1D Array):\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Apply the mask to select elements\n",
    "selected_elements = data[mask]\n",
    "print(\"Selected elements (data > 25):\", selected_elements)\n",

    "\n",
    "print(\"\\n--- Direct application ---\")\n",
    "# You can apply the condition directly without an intermediate mask variable\n",
    "even_numbers = data[data % 2 == 0]\n",
    "print(\"Even numbers:\", even_numbers)\n",
    "# Output: [10 20 30 40]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select numbers between 20 and 35 (inclusive)\n",

    "even_elements = matrix[matrix % 2 == 0]\n",
    "print(\"Even elements from matrix:\\n\", even_elements)\n",
    "# Output: [2 4 6 8]\n",
    "3. Using ~ for NOT:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the tilde operator ~ to negate a boolean mask (select elements that don't meet the condition).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",

    "Concise: Often requires less code than explicit loops or complex conditional statements.\n",

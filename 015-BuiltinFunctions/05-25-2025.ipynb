    "'''The zip() function in Python is used to combine elements from multiple iterables (like lists, tuples, strings, etc.) into a single iterable of tuples. It aggregates elements from each of the input iterables.\n",

    "How zip() works:\n",
    "Takes multiple iterables as arguments: You can pass two, three, or more iterables to zip().\n",
    "Returns an iterator of tuples: Each tuple contains elements from the corresponding positions in the input iterables.\n",
    "Stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted: If the input iterables have different lengths, zip() will stop producing tuples once the shortest iterable runs out of elements.\n",
    "Basic Syntax:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "zip(*iterables)\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "1. Combining two lists:\n",
    "\n",

    "names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]\n",

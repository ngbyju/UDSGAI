    "Why NumPy is More Efficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "C Implementation: NumPy's core operations are implemented in highly optimized C code. Python lists, on the other hand, involve more overhead at the Python object level for each element.\n",
    "Contiguous Memory: NumPy arrays store elements of the same data type in contiguous blocks of memory. This allows for efficient caching and vectorized operations (applying an operation to an entire array at once) without the need for explicit Python loops.\n",
    "No Type Checking Overhead: Standard Python lists can hold objects of different types, which requires Python to perform type checking for every operation. NumPy arrays are typically homogeneous (all elements of the same type), avoiding this overhead.\n",
    "Vectorization: NumPy operations like + are \"vectorized,\" meaning they operate on the entire array at once, delegating the heavy lifting to optimized low-level code. In contrast, Python list operations in a for loop (like the list comprehension [list_a[i] + list_b[i] for i in range(size)]) involve Python's interpreter for each individual element, leading to more overhead.\n",
    "In essence, for numerical computations on large datasets, NumPy leverages underlying C optimizations and efficient memory management to dramatically outperform pure Python lists.\n",
